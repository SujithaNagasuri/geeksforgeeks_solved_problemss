Find length of Loop
Given a linked list of size N. The task is to complete the function countNodesinLoop() that checks whether a given Linked List contains a loop or not and if the 
loop is present then return the count of nodes in a loop or else return 0. C is the position of the node to which the last node is connected. If it is 0 then no loop.


class Solution
{
    //Function to find the length of a loop in the linked list.
    static int countNodesinLoop(Node head)
    {
    
        HashSet<Node> s = new HashSet<Node>();
        Node current = head;
       
        int count =1;
        while(current != null)
       {
           if(s.contains(current))
           {
              Node mover = current.next;
              while(mover != current)
              {
                  count++;
                   mover = mover.next;
              }
              
              
               return count;
               
           }
           s.add(current);
           current = current.next;
       }
       return 0;
        //Add your code here.
    }
}
