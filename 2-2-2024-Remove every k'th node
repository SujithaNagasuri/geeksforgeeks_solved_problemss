Remove every k'th node
Given a singly linked list, your task is to remove every kth node from the linked list.

Input:
The first line of input contains number of test cases T. Then T test cases follow. Every test case contains 3 lines. First line of every test case contains an integer N denoting the size of the linked list . The second line contains N space separated values of the linked list. The third line contains an integer K.

Output:
Output for each test case will be space separated values of the nodes of the new transformed linked list.

User Task:
The task is to complete the function deleteK() which should delete every kth nodes from the linked list.

class GfG
{
    /*You are required to complete this method*/
    
    Node delete(Node head, int k)
    {
        
        Node current = head;
        int i=1;
        if(i==k)
        {
            return null;
        }
        while(current !=null && current.next!=null)
        {
            if(i+1==k)
            {
                i=0;
                current.next = current.next.next;
            }
            i++;
            current = current.next;
        }
        
        return head;
	    
    }
}
